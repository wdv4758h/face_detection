Face Detection
========================================

only detect, no recognition here

Viola–Jones object detection framework
========================================

a real-time object detection proposed in 2001 by Paul Viola and Michael Jones

OpenCV
------------------------------

* opencv_haartraining : old, Haar only
* opencv_traincascade : new, OpenCV 2.x API, both Haar and LBP

(Haar features use float point number, LBP features use integer, so using LBP is much faster than Haar)
